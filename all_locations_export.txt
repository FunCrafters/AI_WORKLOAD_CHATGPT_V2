(Naboo Grass Plains DESCRIPTION)
The Great Grass Plains of Naboo serve as the battlefield for the conflict between the Gungan Grand Army and the Trade Federation droid forces. Rolling green fields stretch endlessly under a bright sky, interrupted only by occasional hills and scattered wetlands. Energy shields flicker in the distance, and the remnants of battle—destroyed droids, smoking war machines, and deep scorch marks—mar the once-pristine landscape.

(Naboo Grass Plains HISTORY)
This was the first full scale attack of what will become the separatist group. The Trade Federations, under the guidance of Palpatine presented their might, yet they lost due to the interference of Padme, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. However, the moment of triumph for Naboo (and the Jedi and the Republic) was a much needed victory for Palpatine, back then a senator for Naboo, and placed him in the position he planned to take as the Chancellor.

(Naboo Grass Plains ENVIRONMENT)
The Battle of Naboo takes place on the Great Grass Plains, an expansive, open battlefield stretching to the horizon, surrounded by rolling green hills and scattered clusters of low-lying trees. The environment is serene yet exposed, with no significant cover or fortifications - only the undulating terrain providing some natural defense. The morning sun casts long shadows across the dewy grass, the air still and heavy with anticipation. The landscape is dominated by an endless sea of green, blades of tall grass rippling in the wind. In the distance, the elegant domes and spires of Theed are barely visible through the atmospheric haze. The sky is a brilliant blue, but the distant silhouettes of Trade Federation battleships in orbit hint at the conflict unfolding. The Gungan army stands in tight, disciplined formations at the battlefield's center, their blue energy shields shimmering in the morning light. Their technology blends organic curves with smooth, reflective surfaces, creating a stark contrast to the rigid, mechanical aesthetic of the droid army. Large, lumbering Fambaas carry shield generators on their backs. Sunlight reflects off the polished surfaces of Gungan boomas - plasma-based weaponry contained in organic, orb-like shells - held in preparation for the first wave of the assault. The Massive MTTs (Multi-Troop Transports) of the Trade Federation forces stand, their mechanical frames grinding against the earth, leaving deep impressions in the grass as they deploy rows of battle droids. The droids unfold with precision, their skeletal forms rising from their transport racks like an unrelenting tide of metal. The sheer scale of the droid army is overwhelming, an unbroken line stretching across the plains.

(Rishi Moon Station DESCRIPTION)
Rishi Moon, located in the Rishi system, was a desolate and solitary satellite of Rishi planet. The moon was frequently bombarded by meteor showers, making its surface even more barren. During the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic established Rishi Station on the moon, which monitored communications to safeguard the neighboring planet Kamino - which housed the Cloning facility of the Republic clones. The Separatist Alliance launched a covert mission to attack the station, hoping to mislead the Republic by giving an "all-clear" signal and preventing the Republic fleet from defending Kamino. Despite their attempt, the Separatist forces failed to succeed. Nevertheless, they would attack Kamino at a later stage of the war. While barren, the moon does accommodate some life forms - the most dangerous one were the Rishi Eels. The eels posed a significant threat, which led to the enforcement of strict rules for Rishi Station staff, prohibiting them from venturing outside under typical conditions. This was due to the eels' ability to kill and consume adult humans. They were impervious to blaster fire, except for their eyes, which, if hit, could cause the blaster bolts to bounce back into their braincase. These eels typically resided in tunnels beneath the moon's surface, but adult eels would come up to hunt prey such as Neebray. They were characterized by their red eyes, four large mandibles that enabled them to ingest their prey whole, blue blood, and skin that was a blend of dark blue and green.

(Rishi Moon Station HISTORY)
Rishi Station, also referred to as Rishi Base, was a surveillance outpost situated on the Rishi moon. Its primary function was to alert Kamino of any impending Separatist onslaughts. This station was the battleground during the Clone Wars and was demolished by clone trooper Hevy to signal a warning to the Republic. In the Clone Wars' second year, BX-series droid commandos eliminated four clone troopers, including Sergeant O'Niner, the base's commanding officer. Despite this, rookie clone troopers Hevy, Fives, and Echo, led by Captain Rex and Commander Cody, managed to regain control of the base. Unfortunately, General Grievous sent reinforcements forcing the clones to destroy the base using Tibanna gas and thermal detonators. With the remote control not working. Hevy decided to detonate the explosives manually, which resulted in the destruction of the surveillance outpost and his own death. This act ensured that the Galactic Republic was alerted by disabling the All Clear signal.

The outpost has a primary structure resembling a saucer or a top-like shape, appearing to be constructed from heavy, paneled metal with an intricate series of lights and windows that give it an industrial look. This main structure sits atop a stout, cylindrical base, connected to a wider platform that anchors it to the rocky terrain below. The color palette suggests the use of blues and grays, blending the outpost into the surrounding environment. The location is very dark in general. The station is on the moon, and during the original battle everything was under dark. There is ambiance lighting casting shadows and highlighting the contours and form of the structure. The saucer section has a complex array of surface details including panels, rivets, and other technological features, with soft lighting from within the outpost spilling out from its windows. This offers a contrast to the dark skies and provides a focus on the outpost’s functionality and habitation.
